 Create a program that takes an IP address entered at the keyboard
 and prints out the number of segments it contains, and the length of each segment.

 An IP address consists of 4 numbers, separated from each other with a full stop.
 But your program should count however many are entered
 Examples of the input you may get are:
			len()
 127.0.0.1
 .192.168.0.1
 10.0.123456.255
 172.16
 255

 So your program should work even with invalid IP Addresses.
 We are just interested in the segments and how long each one is.

 Once you have a working program, here are some more suggestions for invalid input to test:

 .123.45.678.91
 123.4567.8.9.
 123.156.289.10123456
 10.10t.10.10
 12.9.34.6.12.90
 '' - that is, press enter without typing anything

-----------------Expected Output-----------------------
192.168.1.1

Segment 1 contains 3 characters
Segment 2 contains 3 characters
Segment 3 contains 1 characters
Segment 4 contains 1 characters
